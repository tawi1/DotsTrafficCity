Sound Configs
-------------------	

.. _soundConfig:

Common Sound Config
~~~~~~~~~~~~

	.. image:: /images/configs/common/CommonSoundConfig.png

.. _soundCrowdConfig:
	
Crowd Sound Config
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ð¡onfig for crowd background sound. The sound of the crowd is calculated based on of two areas: the inner circle and the outer circle. The sound in the inner circle is louder than the sound in the outer circle.

	.. image:: /images/configs/common/CrowdSoundConfig.png
	
| **Crowd sound data** : crowd :ref:`sound <soundData>` data.
| **Inner crowd sound count** : maximum volume for a given number of pedestrians in the inner circle.
| **Outer crowd sound count** : maximum volume for a given number of pedestrians in the outer circle.
| **Min crowd sound count** : minimum number of pedestrians to play the crowd sound.
| **Max volume** : maximum volume level for the crowd sound.
| **Outer max volume** : maximum volume in the outer circle.
| **Min volume** : minimum volume level for the crowd sound.
| **Inner cell offset** : offset of neighbouring cells relative to current cell in hashmap in the inner circle.
| **Outer cell offset** : offset of neighbouring cells relative to current cell in hashmap in the outer circle.
| **Lerp volume speed** : speed of sound volume change between current value and target value.
