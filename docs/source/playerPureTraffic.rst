Pure Traffic Simulation
=====

If you want to remove all the sample code, including the player feature & extras, and just keep the traffic simulation, follow these steps:

#. Add the `DOTS_SIMULATION` scripting define to your project's `Player settings`.
#. Only works on newly created scenes.
#. Check out the `PureCityStressTest` scene for an example.
