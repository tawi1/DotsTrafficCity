Path
=====

`Path` is a set of :ref:`waypoints <pathWaypointInfo>` along which :ref:`vehicles <trafficCar>` travel and is a connection between :ref:`traffic nodes <trafficNode>`.

How To Create
----------------

`Paths` are generated in :ref:`RoadSegment<roadSegment>` with :ref:`RoadSegmentCreator<roadSegmentCreator>` or you can add them to existing :ref:`road segments<roadSegment>` using the :ref:`TrafficNodePathCreator tool<trafficNodePathCreator>`

----------------

* Each path contains a mask that contains a group of the selected `TrafficGroupType`, depending on the selected :ref:`mask type <groupMaskType>`. 
* A vehicle that has the correct :ref:`TrafficGroupType <trafficCarEntityAuthoring>` can be driven or spawned on this path.
* If the vehicle enters the forbidden :ref:`path <pathWaypointInfo>` or :ref:`path node <pathWaypointInfo>`, the vehicle will automatically attempt to change the current lane (:ref:`test scene <trafficTestSceneTrafficGroup>`).

	.. note::
		**You can change the available types in the enum file:**
